## Adding the Loss pool onto my working Wins Pool


Create a `Pool` model with following properties:
    name:text
    long_name:text
    active:boolean
    sort_order:text

    has_many :users
    has_many :teams, through: :users

Change the users <-> teams relationship to be has_and_belongs_to_many

Navbar at top shows both `pools`

The `sort_order` will call a matching function on Team that defines how they are sorted for winners.
